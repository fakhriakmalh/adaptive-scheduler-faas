This repository provides the source code and related materials for a scheduler implementation targeting Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) environments. The scheduler combines dynamic aging with the Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) algorithm to improve response time and resource efficiency in serverless workloads. The code includes all essential scripts, configurations, and illustrative examples to reproduce the described scheduling behavior.

The implementation is intended for research and educational purposes, and may be extended in future publications. For installation, usage guidelines, and further technical details, please refer to the inline code comments and accompanying scripts. Contributions, suggestions, or feedback are very welcome through the issue tracker or pull requests.
